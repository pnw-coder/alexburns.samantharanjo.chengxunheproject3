WRITEUP:

With your submission, you must include a writeup that touches on the following points.  You may discuss any other ideas that you deem salient to this work:

- What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
- One of the main challenges we encountered while developing this app was integrating the frontend, backend, and database. Previously, we mostly worked on either frontend or backend independently, but this project required us to bring them together seamlessly. It was our first experience connecting all the pieces, and it felt quite challenging. We had to be meticulous at every step to ensure proper communication among the components, bridging these different layers of the application was a significant learning curve for us. Another challenge we encountered was consistently encountering a 400 error when attempting to submit the website to create a new password. Despite many attempts, we couldn't pinpoint the exact issue causing this error. We spent a amount of time investigating possibilities, such as incorrect request formats, server-side validation errors, or misconfigured API endpoints, but none seemed to resolve the issue.

- Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
- Given more time, we would focus on enhancing the frontend to improve the overall aesthetics and user experience of the application. This could improve the visual design to make it more appealing and intuitive for users. More specificlly, we would interactive elements such as animations, transitions, and hover effects can make the user interface more engaging and intuitive. Incorporating interactive feedback for user actions, such as form validation or button animations, can enhance usability and improve the overall user experience. In addition, we wanna implemente a password strength meter to provide real-time feedback on the strength of the user's chosen password can help users create more secure passwords. This feature would visually indicate the strength of the password.

- What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
- When working on this assignment, several assumptions were made to guide our development process effectively. We assumed that the users of our password management service would prioritize simplicity, security, and ease of use. This guided our decisions regarding the features and functionality to include in the application. What's more, we assumed familiarity with the technology stack specified in the assignment, including Node.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs. This allowed us to focus on implementing the required features without spending additional time learning new technologies.

- How long did this assignment take to complete?
- About 30 hours in total
